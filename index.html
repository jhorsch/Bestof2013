      <li class="title">Wearing Pajamas Onto Airplanes</li>
      <li class ="description">During my last trip, I discovered the comfort of wearing pajamas onto airplanes. While changing into pajamas on the  airplane is also a great idea, wearing your pajamas / sweatpants to the airport is an even better one (except for the looks from jealous onlookers). It makes everything more relaxing and comfortable. Plus when you go thru TSA, you don't have to take your belt off or worry about beeping.</li>

      <li class="title">Custom Made Cinelli Bike</li>
      <li class ="description">After doing some riding around the city on a beginner level road bike, I decided to invest in a custom bike with a Italian frame made by Cinelli. The ride experience is night and day.  I was riding pretty much everyday of the summer and into the winter until I had an accident. Broken collarbone with surgery but the worst is over and I can't wait to get back on it.</li>

      <li class="title">Hype Machine</li>
      <li class ="description">Coding for hours every day last quarter, I got really bored of my musical selection and Pandora's lack of variety. A Friend turned me onto Hype Machine which is basically an aggregator of popular songs from music blogs. They basically do the searching for cool new music for you. Song will usually end up on Hype Machine a couple months before they go mainstream on the radio. Great for ambient background music.</li>

      <li class ="description">Went back to Montreal for my second festival in the French-Canadian city.  The talent at the fest blew me away and was more focused on live performing acts rather than just a dj and turntables.  Ill be back for 2014.</li>

      <li class ="description">I am not a big coffee drinker but started drinking last semester to wake me up in the AM. A Friend recommended Trader Joe's Wintery Blend and it is amazing. It basically tastes like Christmas in your mouth thanks to the perfect blend of holiday spices. Also it is only $6.99 for a can!</li>

      <li class="title">Divvy</li>
      <li class ="description">Although the city rarely gets anything right (cough Ventra), I think they actually did a great job with the DIvvy roll out. Even though I own a bike, I use Divvy all the time since it is only $75 for a yearly pass and there are stations everywhere. Divvy is great for short visits to meet friends or getting around town during the summer when you dont want to wait for the CTA.</li>

      <li class="title">Being An Election Off Year</li>
      <li class ="description">It was nice that that 2013 was an election off year because since 2008, it has felt like every year until 2012 was an election year. It was nice to take a rest in 2013 because all hell is about to break loose for the 2014 midterm elections and then inevitably the chatter of 2016 bids by Hillary and Christie. So enjoy the break while it lasted.</li>
